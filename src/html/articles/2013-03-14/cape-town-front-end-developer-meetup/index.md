Yesterday I got to give a small presentation at the newly formed [Cape Town Front End Developer Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/) about a subject very close to my heart; CSS, or rather modular CSS.

Here are the slides:

It was both terrifying and exiting to give my first technical talk to a room full of experienced and knowledgable peers, and if it's something you haven't done yet, I cannot recommend it enough. In the words of the smart chap that convinced me to give it a go: "There's got to be _someone_ that doesn't know about this stuff".

Wise words indeed.

If you do have any questions about any points raised by the presentation, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me on Twitter ([&commat;slocombe](http://twitter.com/slocombe)) or drop me an email ([howzit@richarcher.co.uk](mailto:howzit@richarcher.co.uk)).

Also, if you're in the Cape Town area, please drop by the group sometime â€“ it's got a fantastic vibe that's only just started and going to get better.
